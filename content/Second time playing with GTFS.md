Summary: Second post playing with Israel's Ministry of Transportation GTFS data, with a focus on concurrency stats. Using pandas, seaborn and the all new and cool partridge, some advanced matplotlib tricks, and if you stick till the end, even some bokeh geo.


*Second post of the Playing with GTFS series ([1st](/playing-with-gtfs.html), [3rd](/playing-with-gtfs-iii-geo-graphs.html))*



On the [previous post](/playing-with-gtfs.html), we played with stop time stats. This time I'm digging a little deeper, with a focus on concurrency stats.


Still using pandas, seaborn and the all new and cool partridge. Adding some more advanced matplotlib tricks, and if you stick till the end, even some bokeh geo.
